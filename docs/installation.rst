Python Virtual Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following steps describe how to install errbot and the discord backend into an isolated python virtual environment.

These instructions assume you have access to discord with a bot account configured.  For information on how to setup the bot account see https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

    1. Create a virtual environment for errbot.
    ::

        python3 -m venv <path_to_virtualenv>
        source <path_to_virtualenv>/bin/activate

    2. Install errbot and discord backend.
    ::

        pip install errbot err-backend-discord

    3. Initialise errbot and configure discord.
    ::

        errbot --init

    4. See the :ref:`configuration` section for configuration details.

Changelog

Changes to the backend are maintained directly in the `github changelog <https://github.com/errbotio/err-backend-discord/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_ and
you are encourage to review them before upgrading the backend.

Upgrade notes
========================================================================

v4.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enable Message Content intents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The backend has been updated to use discord.py v2.0.1.  The module has moved from v7 to v10 of the Discord API.  Message content intents support has been added.
You must explicitly permit the bot to have access to Message Content via the Discord bot user interface.

Python 3.7 support has been dropped
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The v2.0 discord module has dropped support for Python 3.7 so you will be required to upgrade to at least Python 3.8 to run the discord backend.


v3.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The backend code has been restructure to follow the source layout.

Some of the class definitions were moved into their own files for easier maintenance.
`DiscordSender` and `DiscordPerson` are now located in `discordlib/person.py` while `DiscordRoom`, `DiscordRoomOccupant` and `DiscordCategory` are in `discordlib/room.py`

If your plugin imports these classes, the import code will need to be updated to use the new location.
